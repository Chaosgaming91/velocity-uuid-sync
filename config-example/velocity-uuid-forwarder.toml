# Velocity UUID Forwarder Configuration
# This file must be placed at: config/velocity-uuid-forwarder.toml

# =================================================================
# Velocity Forwarding Secret
# =================================================================
# This MUST match the secret in your Velocity proxy's velocity.toml
# 
# To find your secret:
# 1. Open velocity.toml on your Velocity proxy
# 2. Look for the [forwarding] section
# 3. Copy the value of the "secret" field
#
# Example from velocity.toml:
#   [forwarding]
#   mode = "modern"
#   secret = "EgAbmtTT4qGk"
#
# Then set it here:
secret = "CHANGE_ME"

# =================================================================
# Debug Logging
# =================================================================
# Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting
# 
# false (default): Normal logging
# true: Detailed logging of all UUID forwarding operations
#
# Debug logs will show:
# - When players connect with forwarding data
# - The UUID being applied
# - The player's original IP address
# - Any signature verification failures
#
debug = false

# =================================================================
# Security Notes
# =================================================================
# 1. NEVER share your secret publicly
# 2. Keep this file secure (don't commit to public repositories)
# 3. The secret should be a random string (generated by Velocity)
# 4. If you change the secret, you must restart both:
#    - The Velocity proxy
#    - All Minecraft servers with this mod
# 5. All servers in your network must use the SAME secret
